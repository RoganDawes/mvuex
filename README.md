Partial Vuex wrapper following the interface concept of these Vue bindings https://github.com/HuckRidgeSW/hvue/.

The code supports:
- state
- mutations (provided from native gopherjs methods)
- actions (provided from native gopherjs methods)

The code won't be developed further by myself, so feel free to grab everything.
